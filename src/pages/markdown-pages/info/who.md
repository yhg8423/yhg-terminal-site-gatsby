#### Summary
> Hello, I am Hyeonggeun Yun who is a researcher at ADD(Agency for Defense Development).
I received B.S degree in convergence engineering(major: computer science) from DGIST.
My research interests are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Interaction, Interaction at Scale, Computational Interaction, and Usable Privacy.
Especially, I want to study a society where humans and computers live together.
