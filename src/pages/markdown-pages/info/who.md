#### Summary
> Hello, I am Hyeonggeun Yun who is an undergraduate student majoring in Transdisciplinary Studies at DGIST.
My research interests are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Interaction at Scale, Human-AI Interaction, and Interactive Web.
Especially, I want to think about how to increase the interaction of people on the web. Also, I want to design a society where humans and artificial intelligence live together.
