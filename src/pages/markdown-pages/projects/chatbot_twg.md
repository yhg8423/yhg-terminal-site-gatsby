> Use of chatbots for emotional exchange is recently increasing in various domains. However, as existing chatbots have been considered in terms of natural language processing techniques for interaction with text-based chatting, there are problems with the flow and the style of the conversation. Consequently, chatbot interaction with users is lacking in terms of considering the emotions of users and managing turn-taking in conversation. We suggest a new interaction technique having touch interactions with graphic interfaces (TwG) to solve these problems. In the proposed system, users send their emotions and manage turn-taking through TwG technique. This project is a part of DGIST UGRP (Undergraduate Group Research Program), and the research is supported by DGIST UGRP Grant.
