> Since 2018, I have been an undergraduate tutor of DGIST. In 2018, I worked as a tutor of General Chemistry I in the first semester and Multivariable Calculus in the second semester. In 2019, I worked as a tutor of Linear Algebra in the first semester and Object-Oriented Programmin in the second semester. Now, I am working as a tutor of Data Structure for this semester.  While I have been working as a tutor, I try to fill the gaps which I did not understand when I was a fresher student. Thanks to the efforts, I was selected as a superb tutor in the first semester of 2018, and the second semester of 2019.
