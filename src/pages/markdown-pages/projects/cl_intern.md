> To help language learners achieve fluency, instructors often focus on teaching formulaic sequences (FS)–phrases such as idioms or phrasal verbs that are processed, stored and retrieved holistically.  Teaching FS effectively is challenging as it heavily involves instructors’ intuition, prior knowledge, and manualefforts to identify a set of FSs with high utility.  We suggest FSIST, a tool that supports instructorsfor video-based instruction of FS. The core idea of FSIST is to utilize videos at scale to build a list of FSs along with videos that include example usages.  To evaluate how FSIST can effectively supportinstructors, we conducted a user study with three English instructors. Results show that the browsing interactions provided in FSIST support instructors to efficiently find parts of videos that show example usages of FSs.
