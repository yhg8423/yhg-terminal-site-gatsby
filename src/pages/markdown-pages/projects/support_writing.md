> There are two types of vocabulary knowledge - vocabulary size & vocabulary control. Generally, non-native Speakers are hard to control vocabulary in English writing. Therefore, we studies on how to support controlling vocabulary in English writing. Our basic approach is using NLP-based interactions to teach knowledges of vocabulary control. In current prototype, learners can learn a specific word and write an example sentence using the word. After that, our prototype fixes and paraphrases the sentence using Transformer-based Language Model (Bert, GPT2).
